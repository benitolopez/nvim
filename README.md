# My Neovim dotfiles

After almost 10 years, I am returning to Vim. It will be a slow, step-by-step process. To ease the transition, I have chosen [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and in particular [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
I will probably continue to use VS Code in my existing projects. But in new projects Neovim will be my default editor (especially for those written in C).
